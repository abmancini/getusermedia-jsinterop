# getusermedia-jsinterop
minimalistic example of accessing WebRTC's getUserMedia on Chrome using JsInterop


Based on JsInterop v1.0 as documented on https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fmlEYIHcyead_4R1S5wKGs1t2I7Fnp_PaNaa7XTEk0/edit#heading=h.828haudjx0kl.
Compiles GWT 2.8.0-beta1

For the sake of simplicity we targeted only Chrome and all the JsInterop annotated classes and methods are in the file Wraps.java
